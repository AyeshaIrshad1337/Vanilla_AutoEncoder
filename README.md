# Vanilla_AutoEncoder

This repository provides an implementation of a Vanilla AutoEncoder, which is a simple neural network architecture used for unsupervised learning tasks. The AutoEncoder is trained to reconstruct its input data, which can be useful for tasks such as dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.

## Python Version

This code is written in Python 3.8. Make sure you have Python 3.8 installed on your system before running the code.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies for running the code.

## Training the Model

To train the AutoEncoder model, run the following command:

```
python train.py
```

This will start the training process and save the trained models in the `models/` folder.

## Using the Saved Models

To use the saved models, navigate to the `models/` folder. You will find the trained models saved in this directory. You can load these models in your own code for further analysis or inference.
